            <strong>Dr. Robert Jay Lifton</strong> said that when people keep hearing the same ideas again and again, their brain stops thinking
            properly. They start copying those ideas without checking if they are right or wrong. It’s like their mind gets stuck.
            He believed that a healthy brain should ask questions, but “brainrot” happens when people just agree with everything
            they hear.

            Robert Jay Lifton is an American psychiatrist and author known for studying how extreme social and political forces
            can shape the human mind. He connects psychology, history, and ethics in his research, exploring how people adapt—or
            mentally distort—under pressure from ideology and authority. He has examined how repetition, propaganda, and
            obedience can rewire moral judgment, leading individuals to accept harmful beliefs without question. He believes
            that mental health and moral clarity depend on the ability to reflect, question, and stay open to change rather than
            surrendering to fixed ideas.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>- He authored Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism (1961), a groundbreaking study on how
                authoritarian systems manipulate thought and identity.</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>- He introduced the concept of “thought reform,” explaining how constant exposure to the same ideology limits
                independent reasoning.</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>- He examined the psychology of war, genocide, and nuclear threat in works such as The Nazi Doctors and The
                Climate Swerve.</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>- He warned that modern digital environments can mimic “totalistic systems,” where repeated ideas restrict
                open thinking — a condition similar to brainrot.</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>- He continues to advocate for critical thinking, empathy, and moral reflection as essential defenses against
                mental conformity and ideological control.</strong></p>
