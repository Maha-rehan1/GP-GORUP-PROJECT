                    <p><strong>Tung Tung Tung Sahur</strong> is an Indonesian brainrot character made by Noxa, an
                        Indonesian tiktoker who created several
                        different Italian brainrot characters alongside AI videos. Tung Tung Tung Sahur is a log who
                        wields a baseball bat as a
                        weapon who was pubished on the 1st of March, 2025. The word “Tung” represents the beat of a
                        kentongan, which is a
                        traditional Indonesian communication tool made from hollowed-out bamboo or wood, struck with a
                        mallet to produce loud
                        sounds for local alerts. And the word “Sahur” also written as Sahoor is an islamic tradition in
                        which Muslims wake up at
                        dawn before sun rises on the days of Ramadan, to prepare for the fast. So the meaning behind
                        this character was to wake
                        up the muslims at a proper time so they can carry out sahur.
                        It’s an abnormal creature that appears during Sahur. It’s said that if someone is called for
                        sahur three times and does
                        not answer, then this creature will come to your house.</p>

                    Since then, the Tung Tung Tung Sahur trend has absolutely exploded across TikTok. Creators
                    everywhere are putting their
                    own spin on it: recreating the sound, remixing the audio, and animating a host of AI characters
                    using the iconic chant.
                    The Tung Tung Tung Sahur filter has only added to the meme magic, making participation in the trend
                    a creative badge of
                    honor on the platform. People have also made stories out of this character showing how this has
                    become a huge part of
                    our writings.

                    However, it has also sparked controversy regarding its narration. Viewers have deemed lines such as
                    "Non crede in Allah"
                    and "bombarda i bambini a Gaza e in Palestina" offensive, as it is perceived to mock the military
                    conflict in Gaza.
                    Despite this, this brainrot has inspired a significant amount of spin-off brainrots, which is a
                    goose superimposed on a
                    bomber plane, with some of these having achieved mainstream recognition. In late 2025, Bombardiro
                    Crocodilo was removed
                    from the Roblox game Plants vs Brainrots due to an unknown reason. However, fans of the game have
                    speculated online it
                    could be due to copyright, however this is just a claim.

                    <p><strong>Tralalero Tralala</strong> sometimes is the first and one of the popular Italian
                        brainrot characters. It looks like a shark, has
                        side fins that look like legs, it has three feet and he wears blue Nike shoes on them. It is
                        usually in a beach setting.
                        There are sea waves and seagulls behind Tralalero Tralala. The whole trend started on TikTok
                        earlier this year. Some guy
                        made a short video with this weird AI audio saying “Tralalero Tralala,” and then paired it
                        with an image of the shark.
                        And for some reason, the internet just ran with it.

                    <p> While some people say that Tralalero Tralala is a whimsical, melodic expression rooted in
                        folk singing and widely used
                        as a fun, meaningless filler in songs and speech. Whether you encounter it in Italian
                        polyphonic music or in a casual
                        online meme, the essence of the phrase is playfulness, rhythm, and carefree joy rather than
                        literal meaning. The
                        translation however has a whole different meaning.</p>

                    <p><strong>Lirilì Larilà</strong> is a well-known Italian Brainrot Character published on the 10th of February, 2025. He is a two-legged
                    elephant with a cactus body and two slippers. Appears in the desert with something resembling hot air balloons or
                    seashells and a floating alarm clock in the background. It wanders the desert with a floating tiny mystical clock.
                    Instead of elephant feet, Lirili's two legs end in oversized beach slippers. According to Fictional Stories, Lirilì
                    Larilà can grow up to 15-18 feet tall.

                    performance in battle, even defeating Tung Tung Tung Sahur. He has also been able to defeat characters like Cappuccino
                    Assassino by just stomping him with his giant feet/sandals. Lirilì Larilà wanders the desert in eternal search of water
                    and attention. This bizarre creature is essentially a giant living cactus with the head of an elephant, complete with
                    floppy ears and a tiny trunk. Instead of elephant feet, Lirili's two legs end in oversized beach slippers.
